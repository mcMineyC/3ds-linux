Linux kernel
============

This kernel has been ported to the Nintendo 3DS.  To clone, MAKE SURE you add the --depth 1 argument, otherwise the kernel will panic on bootup.
NOTE: Make sure you have a file named rootfs.cpio.gz in the root directory of this repo that contains the rootfs from buildroot.

To build, first install the development packages from the following command: 
sudo apt install git build-essential flex bison gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi libssl-dev bc gcc-arm-none-eabi
Then, clone the sources: git clone https://github.com/linux-3ds/linux.git --depth=1
Finally, compile using make:
ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- make -j$(nproc) nintendo3ds_defconfig all



There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
